# Technical Issues Resolution

Date: July 11, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ROUND Function Error in PostgreSQL

**Problem:**
- The `writing-production:get_writing_progress` endpoint was failing with the error: 
  ```
  Error: function round(double precision, integer) does not exist
  ```
- This was happening because PostgreSQL requires proper type casting when using the ROUND function with double precision values.

**Solution:**
1. Created migration `20250710_fix_round_double_precision.sql` that:
   - Added a utility function `round_double_precision` to handle rounding double precision values
   - Updated all views to use proper casting with `::numeric` to ensure ROUND function works correctly
   
2. Updated the `getWritingProgress` method in `src/writing-server/index.js` to use numeric casting:
   ```sql
   ROUND((b.word_count::numeric / NULLIF(b.target_word_count, 0)::numeric) * 100.0, 2)
   ```

### 2. Missing Implementation in Research Server

**Problem:**
- The `research-continuity:generate_series_report` function was returning placeholder text instead of actual report content:
  ```json
  "content": "Progress report would be generated here"
  ```

**Solution:**
1. Implemented a full version of the `generateProgressReport` method in `src/research-server/index.js` that:
   - Retrieves series information
   - Gets books and their progress with appropriate metrics
   - Collects writing sessions data for overall statistics
   - Retrieves writing goals
   - Generates a comprehensive progress report with all relevant data

## Testing

A test script `test-round-function-fix.js` was created to verify:
1. The ROUND function works correctly with proper type casting
2. The progress report query executes successfully

All tests passed, confirming that both issues have been fixed.

## Instructions for Development Team

1. Run the migration script when deploying the fix: 
   ```powershell
   .\run-migration.ps1
   ```

2. Restart all servers after applying the migration to ensure the changes take effect

3. For future development:
   - Always use `::numeric` casting when using ROUND function in PostgreSQL
   - Use the `calculate_percentage` helper function for consistent percentage calculations
   - Ensure that placeholders in the code are properly implemented before deployment

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive validation and error handling for functions that work with the database

2. Implement more detailed tests for database operations to catch type conversion issues early

3. Create a monitoring system to detect and alert when database functions fail
